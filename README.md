### Grapefruit Beamer Template

This is a simple and sleek design for Latex Beamer slides. The colors remind me of a grapefruit, hence the name.
The colors are easily adjustable, if you want to change them, but why would you :P

To see how it looks, view this [PDF](https://github.com/sarahwinter/grapefruit-beamer-template/blob/master/main.pdf).

If I find the time and mood, I will turn this into a proper Beamer theme. For now the style is achieved by inputting `style.tex` into your Beamer document, as done in `main.tex` which contains the frames of the presentation.

The file `main.tex` should have enough examples to build your own slides and make color adjustments.
